# 🎨 Air Sketch using Hand Gestures

Air Sketch is a Python-based computer vision project that allows users to draw on the screen using **hand gestures captured through a webcam**. The application detects finger movements in real time and converts them into drawing actions on a virtual canvas.

This project demonstrates how hand tracking can be used for **touchless interaction** without relying on a mouse or keyboard.
